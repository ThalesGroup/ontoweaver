Truncated ATRX variants in both alpha thalassaemia mental retardation (ATR-X) syndrome and alpha thalassemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS) are most commonly detected in the highly conserved helicase domain and also the P-box and Q-box domains, potential protein-interaction domains (PMID: 8968741, 14592816, 18409179, 17609377). In some cases, the truncated ATRX phenotype can be rescued by expression of a downstream start site through intraexonic skipping of the mutant allele, consistent with a hypomorphic effect (PMID: 18409179, 15591283). Based on loss of function studies, ATRX deletions are expected to result in chromosomal instability and alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) (PMID: 21719641, 24148618).';'The ATRX R1425Gfs*65 is a truncating mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore is likely oncogenic.';'136:variant';'id';'BiologicalEntity|Entity|NamedThing|SequenceVariant'

Mutations in the DBD result in conformational changes of the protein, altering contact of TP53 with its target DNA sequences and thereby altering transcriptional function (PMID: 8023157, 11900253). Given that TP53 directs the transcription of proteins that enable apoptosis, the inactivation of TP53 results in cells harboring damaged DNA and overall genomic instability (PMID: 11900253, 11900253).';'The TP53 G108_R110del alteration is likely oncogenic.';'137:variant';'id';'BiologicalEntity|Entity|NamedThing|SequenceVariant'

PIK3CA gene amplification has been correlated with PIK3CA protein overexpression (PMID: 17992665,19697359). PIK3CA overexpression enhances growth and migration (PMID: 17803655, 26876212). PIK3CA amplifications associate with poor prognosis in several cancers (PMID: 22994622, 22292935, 27095573).

Amplification of PIK3CA known pathogenic mutant alleles have also been reported (PMID: 19706770).
