Specifically, in follicular lymphoma BCL6 amplification was observed in a cohort of tumors lacking otherwise typical IGH/BCL2 rearrangements (PMID: 18500267, 24887414). BCL6 is a transcriptional regulator in germinal centers, from which human lymphomas often derive. In model systems, overexpression of BCL6 results in an anti-apoptotic and chemotherapy resistant phenotype (PMID: 15577913, 16142238).",Likely Gain-of-function,"16142238,18500267,24887414,15577913",[],,,,,,[],[],,"BCL6, a transcriptional repressor involved in immune cell development, is frequently altered by chromosomal rearrangement in lymphomas.",BCL6 amplification is likely oncogenic.,There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with BCL6-amplified high-grade serous ovarian cancer.,,,[],[],,v4.10,2019-02-06 00:00:00,,35
